100-python
==========

If I get a job I'm up for, I'll have to learn python.  May as well learn it now.  So, one hundred things from python I'll probably want to know

I'll probably regret setting a number.  Anyway I'm going to start with maybe 50 and add stuff as needed.

First some things I know already
1. python files usually end with .py
2. python is a dynamically typed interpreted (generally anyway) langage
3. python avoids braces and semicolons and other punctuation, where possible
4. a list in python is a tuple
5. pip installs python packages
6. python uses indentation for scope

1. hash bang for python invocation from the shell #!/usr/bin/env python
2. declarations if a variable (name = value )
3. an integer (number without a decimal place)
4. a floating point number (number with a decimal place)
5. a string (" ", ' ' or """ around the string literal can use the print formatting to alter strings when assigning)
6. an array (a list, declared like list = ['a', 2, 'cee']
7. a character a single char string
8. a hash (dictionary dic = {'a': 1, 'b': 2} )
9. a tuple  
10. a constant
11. a class (class)
12. an object
13. an import from a global library (import sys)
14. an import from a local library
15. loop (maybe go over an array)
16. second type of loop (while loop)
17. third type of loop (count loop)
18. subroutine/function (def name(parameters):
19. a static variable
20. a global variable
21. how to open a text file to read it 
22. how to open a text file to write it
23. how to declare a package/library
24. how to read a line from STDIN (raw_input(prompt))
25. how to read a line from an opened file 
26. how to write a line to STDOUT (print) (note, can use , to chain elements in print, will evalue outside of commas %s for string %d for integer %item for one item or %(value1, value2) for more then one value)
27. how to write a line to an opened file
28. how to close a file
29. how to do regex matching in python
30. how to do substitution in python (a, b) = (b, a)
31. array length (len(arrayname))
32. how to do a single line comment (#)
33. is a multi line comment different, and if so, (how? nope #)
34. how to find out a substring
35. how to search for a character, or a set of characters, in a string
36. how to access an element in an array arrayname[index], can use negative numbers (-1 is end of array, -2 is 1 before end of array)
37. how to sort an array array.sort(function to sort with)
38. how to pull out keys from a dictionary (dict["key"])
39. how to add to a hash (as above)
40. how to delete a key from a hash (del dict["key"] dict.clear() to delete dictionary)
41. how to have multiple scalars (or whatever the equivalent term is) in a hash value, array element, etc.
42. how to do bit level manipulations (is it possible, and how).
43. how to invoke shell commands
44. how to get the output of shell commands, and how to get their exit status
45. forking/threading, or equivalent
46. what is the NULL/undef term 
47. what is true (True)
48. what is false (False)
49. Can I define things to be clearer, like in C?
50. how to invoke the debugger
51. How to cast to an integer/float form the opposite (int(float), ?)
