100-python
==========

If I get a job I'm up for, I'll have to learn python.  May as well learn it now.  So, one hundred things from python I'll probably want to know

I'll probably regret setting a number.  Anyway I'm going to start with maybe 50 and add stuff as needed.

First some things I know already
1. python files usually end with .py
2. python is a dynamically typed interpreted (generally anyway) langage
3. python avoids braces and semicolons and other punctuation, where possible
4. a list in python is a tuple
5. pip installs python packages
6. python uses indentation for scope

1. hash bang for python invocation from the shell #!/usr/bin/python
2. declarations
3. an integer (for integer math tricks)
4. a floating point number
5. a string
6. an array
7. a character
8. a hash (I think it's called a dictionary)
9. a tuple 
10. a constant
11. a class
12. an object
13. an import from a global library
14. an import from a local library
15. loop (maybe go over an array)
16. second type of loop (while loop)
17. third type of loop (count loop)
18. subroutine/function
19. a static variable
20. a global variable
21. how to open a text file to read it

28. how to close a file
29. how to do regex matching in python
30. how to do substitution in python
31. array length
32. how to do a single line comment

34. how to find out a substring
35. how to search for a character, or a set of characters, in a string
36. how to access an element in an array
37. how to sort an array
38. how to pull out keys from a hash
39. how to add to a hash
40. how to delete a key from a hash
41. how to have multiple scalars (or whatever the equivalent term is) in a hash value, array element, etc.
42. how to do bit level manipulations (is it possible, and how).
43. how to invoke shell commands
44. how to get the output of shell commands, and how to get their exit status
45. forking/threading, or equivalent
46. what is the NULL/undef term
47. what is true
48. what is false
49. Can I define things to be clearer, like in C?
50. how to invoke the debugger
